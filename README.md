### What we learned

# Part 1: Functions

For part 1, the first exercise is to create a calling function to print the message inside the function greet().

The second exercise is a overridden function of the greet() to take a parameter and prints the message inside the parameter as the output.

The add function for part 1 takes in two parameters and returns the sum of both values as an output.

The fourth exercise of part 1 is implementing a method to convert a value of temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit using the expression, ($c * 9/5) + 32.

For the last exercise for part 1, the function to safely divide two numbers and prints an error message if the denominator is 0.


# Part 2: Arrays

First exercise is to create a array of 5 numbers and use the function min() and max() to find the smallest and largest element inside the array.

Second exercise is to create array with keys as student names and values as student grades and printing the elements inside the array.

Array modification is a combination of certain operations inside for an array of [1,2,3] and using the array_push() to add an element to array and using array_pop() to remove an element from the end of the array using array_merge to combine pre-built array and new array of elements [5, 6].

Exercise 4 is to use the function to count the occurrences of the identical values inside the array using the array_count_values() and print the output.


# Part 3: Combine Functions and Arrays
I learned how to combine functions and arrays in PHP to calculate averages and assign letter grades
,and how to handle associative arrays within if statements and loops to process data efficiently.
